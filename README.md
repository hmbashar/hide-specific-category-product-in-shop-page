# hide-specific-category-product-in-shop-page
As ‘clothing’ is an example in the snippet below, be sure to use a product category slug that exists in your WooCommerce store.  Note that this will only work when you have your “Shop Page Display” option set to ‘Show Products’ under WooCommerce > Settings > Products > Display.  You will need to put this code in your theme’s functions.php file.
